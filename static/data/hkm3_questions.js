These typically include proof of age, a medical examination report, and a completed proposal form. Financial statements for the last three years are not typically required for a life insurance policy application. The Insurance Companies Ordinance (Cap. 41) of Hong Kong provides regulations regarding the documentation necessary for insurance applications, emphasizing the importance of accurate and complete information in proposal forms, medical reports, and proof of age. Financial statements are more relevant in the context of investment or financial planning products rather than life insurance policies.",

The Insurance Authority\u2019s Guideline on Life Insurance and Family Takaful Business specifies that insurers must establish procedures for processing changes to policy provisions, including beneficiary designations. Verbal notifications to insurance agents may not suffice, as formal documentation is necessary to ensure the accuracy and legality of the changes. Waiting until policy renewal may not be advisable, especially if there is an urgent need to update beneficiary information.

One such criterion is that the applicant must be of legal age, typically 18 years or older. The Insurance Companies Ordinance (Cap. 41) sets out regulations regarding the eligibility requirements for insurance contracts, and age limits are among the fundamental criteria. Therefore, if the applicant is below the age of 18, the application is likely to be rejected. Other factors such as failure to provide proof of age or inaccurate disclosures of medical history can also lead to application rejection. However, if the applicant accurately discloses pre-existing medical conditions, the application may still be considered, albeit with possible adjustments to premiums or coverage terms.",

A grace period is a specified period after the premium due date during which the policy remains in force, even if the premium has not been paid. During this grace period, policyholders typically have the option to reinstate the policy by paying the overdue premiums, along with any applicable interest or fees. This provision allows policyholders to maintain their coverage despite temporary financial difficulties or oversight in premium payments.

With increasing term life insurance, the death benefit grows over the policy\u2019s term, usually at a predetermined rate or in line with inflation. This ensures that the coverage amount maintains its purchasing power, providing adequate financial protection for Mr. Lee\u2019s beneficiaries. Unlike level term or decreasing term policies, where the death benefit remains constant or decreases over time, increasing term life insurance aligns with Mr. Lee\u2019s objective of preserving the value of the death benefit.

When a policyholder surrenders their whole life insurance policy, they forfeit the coverage provided by the policy, as well as the associated death benefit payable to beneficiaries upon the insured\u2019s death.

Unlike term life insurance, where premiums are fixed for the policy\u2019s term, universal life insurance offers greater flexibility and customization options.

Contingent beneficiaries are individuals or entities designated to receive the death benefit if the primary beneficiary predeceases the insured. By naming his children as contingent beneficiaries, Mr. Tam ensures that the death benefit will pass to them according to his wishes in the specified circumstances. It\u2019s essential for Mr. Tam to update the beneficiary designation with the insurer to reflect his current intentions accurately.

When a policyholder borrows against the cash value of the policy, the loan amount is typically deducted from the death benefit payable to beneficiaries upon the insured\u2019s death, thereby reducing the amount received by beneficiaries. Additionally, policy loans may accrue interest, which can increase the total amount owed over time, leading to higher premium payments to maintain the policy\u2019s coverage.
