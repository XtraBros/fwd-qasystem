Moving a portion of the portfolio from provincial to investment grade corporate bonds will increase returns. ABC can still maintain the same asset liability matching policy so net income volatility will not be affected. ANSWER: B.

High yield bonds are highly correlated with other fixed income assets and would introduce additional interest rate sensitivity. ANSWER: D. Acquiring preferred shares will increase yields in a low interest rate environment.
